# Semiconductor Wafer Defect Detection

## Overview

This project aims to detect defects in semiconductor wafers using image processing and machine learning techniques. Semiconductor wafer defect detection is crucial in the manufacturing process to ensure the production of high-quality chips for various electronic devices.

The project utilizes a dataset of wafer images and applies defect detection algorithms to identify and classify defects. It is designed to automate the defect detection process, improving accuracy, efficiency, and reducing human intervention in semiconductor wafer inspection.

## Features

- **Wafer Defect Detection:** Uses machine learning models to classify wafer images as defective or non-defective.
- **Preprocessing:** Includes image preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation for better model performance.
- **Model Training:** This module implements different machine learning algorithms for defect classification.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization of detected defects on wafer images.
Performance Evaluation:** This includes performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluating the model.
